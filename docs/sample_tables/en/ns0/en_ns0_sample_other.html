He predicted that starlings traveling further would spend more time at the foraging site to achieve optimal foraging behavior. It’s important that these starlings spend extra time at the foraging ground because it takes a lot of energy to travel back and forth from its nest. On the other hand, he predicted starlings traveling shorter distances to foraging grounds should spend less time foraging, making more frequent trips in order to optimize their behavior. Since these starlings have a shorter distance to travel, they don’t need to put as much energy into searching for leatherjackets because it is easier for them to return to the foraging ground. His results were consistent with his predictions.<br/> <br/> [[File:Picture1ofoptimality.png|thumb|left|240px|upright|Upright|These two graphs show the effects of travel time on optimal behavior. The loading curve, based solely on foraging time and number of captured prey, is shown in black. Travel time is measured along the x-axis, from the origin to the start of the loading curve. The optimum load size is determined by drawing a line, originating at the origin, tangent to the loading curve.

It has been discovered that in cases where two male dung flies copulate with the same female in relatively rapid succession, the second male will fertilize 80% of the eggs, while the first male will only fertilize 20%. This creates a dilemma for male dung flies. The longer they remain with a female after copulation, the better they are able to guard her from copulating with other males, hence increasing the likelihood of passing his genes to her offspring. However, the longer the male remains with an individual female, the smaller chance he has of finding other mates.

For example, short distances between cowpats should widen the pool of available mates in a specific geographic location. Parker predicted that under this condition, dung flies would be more likely to leave their current mate sooner to find additional mates. But if cowpats are few and far between, it would benefit a male dung fly to spend more time guarding a mate, ensuring his genes are passed on, because he may have difficulty finding an additional mate. The results from Parker’s experiment agree with this model.<br/>+Dung flies are a polygamous species that mate on cowpats.

To break the shell of the mollusk, the crows fly and drop the whelks on rocks. Reto Zach constructed an optimality model to predict the optimal height at which crows drop the whelks<ref name="Zach" />. The benefit in this model is the success rate of cracking the whelk’s shell, while the primary cost is the energy spent flying. If the crows did not fly high enough, they would have little success in breaking the whelks’ shells. However, the crows could waste valuable energy if they climb too high. In his model, Zach predicted the optimal height for crows to drop the whelks. To do this, Zach calculated the total distance each whelk was dropped before it was successfully broken. Whelks dropped from 3 meters and lower actually had traveled high total distances because they had to be dropped numerous times in order to be broken. On the other hand, whelks dropped from 5 meters and 15 meters were dropped approximately the same number of times to initiate a break; however, the crows would obviously have to climb higher to break a whelk at 15 meters than at 5 meters. Zach predicted 5 meters to be the optimal dropping height. The results indicated that the crows do follow this model, as the average dropping height was 5.2 meters.<br/>+On the Pacific coast of Canada, crows forage on [[whelks]], a species of mollusks.

Mutations can push populations away from the optimum. Additionally, beneficial and detrimental alleles sometimes stay together due to genetic linkage, inherently preventing an “optimal” state. This situation illustrates the broader perspective of genes as interacting together, as opposed to producing a combined result of independently arising characteristics. Environmental factors include graded responses to the environment, environmental heterogeneity, and evolutionary lag. All individuals are different and display different responses to the environment, and all environments are heterogeneous. These differences make it difficult to identify a precisely “optimal” state for any particular individual in any specific environment. Similarly, if an environment or microenvironment fluctuates rapidly, animals cannot respond to evolutionary pressures quickly enough to present a well-adapted, optimal form of their species.<br/> <br/>-Some alternative or complementary strategies to describing and analyzing animal behavior include the [[comparative method]] and [[quantitative genetics]].<ref name="Parker" /> By comparing different species and possible explanations, one can utilize the comparative method as a complement to optimality models and/or quantitative genetics.

There are two couples in each dance-off, the two of which have the lowest scores between the judges and the public. The aim of the dance off is for the couples to convince the judges that they deserve to go through to the following week's competition. Before they attempt the dance a second time the couple sometimes gets advice from the judges. The judges decide based on the dance performed the second time. If the judges agree with the exception of [[Len Goodman]] the couple is through to the following week's competition. If one couple has two votes and the other couple has one vote, then the final vote is down to the Head Judge, [[Len Goodman]]. He has the deciding vote and whichever couple he chooses to save is through to the following week meaning the other couple is eliminated. However, when Craig, Arlene/Alesha/Darcey and Bruno agree and Len disagrees, then Len's vote does not count as already the safe couple would have had more votes. The eliminated couple talk about their experience or watch a video of their time on the show.

His major screen time occurs in the first installment, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. He appears briefly in flashbacks in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', as well as in a scene from the extended edition of ''The Two Towers''. Before casting finished, rumours circulated that Jackson had considered Bean for the role of [[Aragorn II|Aragorn]], but neither Bean nor Jackson confirmed this in subsequent interviews. Bean's fear of flying in helicopters caused him difficulties in mountainous [[New Zealand]], where the trilogy was filmed. After a particularly rough ride, he vowed not to fly to a location again; in one instance, he chose to take a [[ski lift]] into the mountains while wearing his full costume (complete with shield, armour, and sword) and then hike the final few miles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flightplan interview |url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/flightplan/bean.asp |accessdate=14 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070210104757/http://www.ugo.com:80/channels/filmtv/features/flightplan/bean.asp |archivedate=10 February 2007 }}</ref><br/> <br/>-Other roles gave more scope for his acting abilities.
