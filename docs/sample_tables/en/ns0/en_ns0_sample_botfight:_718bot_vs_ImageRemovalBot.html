As far back as 1867 Parkes at an intercolonial conference had said: ''"I think the time has arrived when these colonies should be united by some federal bond of connexion."''  Shortly afterwards a bill to establish the proposed federal council was introduced by him and passed through both the New South Wales houses.  This was afterwards shelved by the action of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Various other conferences were held in the next 20 years at which the question came up, in which Parkes took a leading part, but in October 1884 he was blowing cold and suggesting that it would be "better to let the idea of federation mature in men's minds", and New South Wales then stood out of the proposed federal council scheme. <br/> <br/>-<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mp005988.jpg|left|thumb|A wood engraving of Sir Henry Parkes moving the first resolution at the federation conference in Melbourne, March 1 1890]] -->In October 1889 a report on the defences of Australia suggested among other things the federation of the forces of all the Australian colonies and a uniform gauge for railways.

The oration was seen as a clarion call to federalists and he called for a convention "to devise the constitution which would be necessary for bringing into existence a federal government with a federal parliament for the conduct of national undertaking".</td>

Older vehicles (and those in [[developing countries]]) are more likely to have their patterns painted on, whereas modern appliances often carry [[Retroreflector|retro-reflective]] designs which reflect light from car headlights or torches.  Patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called '[[battenburg markings]]', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads - often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards if on the rear) or stripes (along the side - these were the first type or retro-reflective devices introduced, as the original retro-reflective material came only in tape form).  In some countries, in addition to retro-reflective markings, vehicles are now painted a bright yellow or orange, although in many other countries, red remains the colour for fire engines.<br/> <br/> Another passive marking is the word ''FIRE'', ''RESCUE'' or local language variant spelled out in reverse on the front of the vehicle.  This enables drivers of other vehicles to more easily identify an approaching fire service vehicle in their [[rear view mirror]]s.

The Okwanuchu occupied territory south, southwest, and southeast of [[Mount Shasta|Mount Shasta]], California, [[United States|USA]], including the present-day cities of [[Mount Shasta, California]], [[McCloud, California]] and [[Dunsmuir, California]], the upper [[Sacramento River]] downstream to North Salt Creek, the Squaw Valley Creek drainage, and the upper [[McCloud River]] downstream to where it meets Squaw Valley Creek. <br/> <br/> The Okwanuchu were speakers of the older [[Hokan]]-speaking family of languages, with archaeological sites associated with their range dating back in excess of 5000 years.  Members of the [[Penutian]]-speaking family of languages, especially the [[Wintu]], arrived in central Northern California in the vicinity of [[Redding, California]] about 1200 years ago, likely from southern Oregon.  The Wintu possessed superior technology, were out-competing their Hokan-language family neighbors, and were expanding Wintu territory at the expense of the Okwanuchu and the [[Achomawi]] to the north, and the [[Yana people|Yana]] to the east.  It appears likely that even if Europeans and Americans not intervened (beginning in the 1820s), the Wintu would have absorbed or otherwise eliminated the Okwanuchu over the course of the coming centuries.<br/> <br/>-Anthropologist [[Alfred L.

His talent from the first revealed itself as strictly academical, full of elegance and grace, but somewhat lacking originality. In the course of his residence in [[Italy]] Baudry derived strong inspiration from Italian art with the mannerism of [[Correggio]], as was very evident in the two works he exhibited in the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] of [[1857]], which were purchased for the Luxembourg: ''The Martyrdom of a Vestal Virgin and The Child''. His ''Leda'', ''St John the Baptist'', and a ''Portrait of Beul'', exhibited at the same time, took a first prize that year. Throughout this early period Baudry commonly selected mythological or fanciful subjects, one of the most noteworthy being ''The Pearl and the Wave'' (1862). Once only did he attempt an historical picture, ''Charlotte Corday after the murder of Marat'' ([[1861]]); and returned by preference to the former class of subjects or to painting portraits of illustrious men of his day: [[Guizot]], [[Charles Garnier]], [[Edmond About]].</td>

The absence of a [[flash suppressor]] and [[selective fire|fire selector]] lever plus the addition of a [[cocking handle]] extension also differentiate the two.  The absence of a flash suppressor also means the weapon cannot fire [[Grenade launcher|rifle grenades]] or mount a bayonet. The GP rifle is based on the L85A1 SA80 rifle, but with absence of gas parts (as above). The GP also has a weighted trigger since it was designed as a target rifle. This is not dissimilar to the 'snowcutter' trigger on the SA80A2.<br/> <br/> There is also a drill purpose version of the L98A1, designated L103A1. This weapon cannot chamber rounds as the firing pin is cut short and the barrel filled with cement. This weapon is commonly identified by two white stripes with the letters 'DP' (DP- Drill Purpose) being painted on the hand guard and trigger mechanism housing. In addition, the bolt is painted red. The DP rifle is normally used for parades and ceremonial parade drill training at individual units. <br/>-<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:DSCF0987.JPG|thumb|300px|A Cadet with L98A1 showing details of the cocking handle and sights (note the large foresight post).]] --><br/>+[[Image:DSCF0987.JPG|thumb|300px|A Cadet with L98A1 showing details of the cocking handle and sights (note the large foresight post).]]<br/> [[Image:L98 target rifle.JPG|thumb|300px|The L98 and cadet in the prone position.]]<br/> <br/> == Breakdown ==</td>
