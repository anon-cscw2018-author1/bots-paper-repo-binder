[[City of Burnside|Burnside]] was inhabited by the [[Kaurna people|Kaurna]] [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous]] people prior to European settlement, living around the creeks of the [[River Torrens]] during the winter and in the [[Adelaide Hills]] during the summer<!--For such a specific claim, we need an inline reference-->. The area was first settled in 1839 by Peter Anderson, a [[Scotland|Scots]] migrant, who named it Burnside after his property's location adjacent to Second Creek (in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scots]], 'Burn' means creek or stream). The [[Burnside, South Australia|village of Burnside]] was established shortly after, and the [[District Council of Burnside]] was gazetted in 1856, separating itself from the larger East Torrens Council.<br/> <br/>-The mainstays of the early Burnside economy were [[viticulture]], mining and olive groves;  [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]] boasted substantial mineral deposits, and vineyards were established at [[Magill, South Australia|Magill]]. The present council chambers were built in 1926 in [[Tusmore, South Australia|Tusmore]]; the council became a [[municipality]] in 1935. With strong growth and development throughout the region, Burnside was then proclaimed a city in 1943. The 1960s brought to Burnside a community library and a swimming centre; both were further expanded and upgraded between 1997 and 2001.

A typical blog combines text, images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. Most blogs are primarily textual although some focus on [[photograph]]s ([[photoblog]]), [[video]]s ([[vlog]]), or [[audio]] ([[podcasting]]), and are part of a wider network of [[social media]].<br/>-<br/>-The word ''blog'' can also be used as a verb, meaning ''to maintain or add content to a blog.''<br/>-<br/>-== History ==<br/>-[[Chronicle]]s, [[commonplace]]s, [[personal journal|diaries]], and [[perzine]]s can all be seen as predecessors of blogs.<br/>-<br/>-Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including [[Usenet]], [[electronic mailing list|e-mail lists]] and [[bulletin board system]]s (BBS). In the 1990s, [[Internet forum]] software, such as [[WebEx]], created running conversations with "threads". Threads are topical connections between messages on a metaphorical "corkboard".<br/>-<br/>-=== 1994 – 2001 ===<br/>-{{Main|Online diary}}<br/>-[[Image:Brad Fitzpatrick.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Brad Fitzpatrick]], an early blogger.]]<br/>-The modern blog evolved from the [[online diary]] where people would keep a running account of their personal lives. Most such writers called themselves diarists, [[journalist]]s, or journalers. A few called themselves [[escribitionist]]s. The Open Pages [[webring]] included members of the online-journal community. [[Justin Hall]], who began eleven years of personal blogging in 1994 while a student at [[Swarthmore College]], is generally recognized as one of the earliest bloggers.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/20/MNGBKBEJO01.DTL|title=Time to get a life — pioneer blogger Justin Hall bows out at 31|publisher=SFgate|date=2005-02-20|accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref><br/>-<br/>-Other forms of journals kept online also existed. A notable example was game programmer [[John Carmack|John Carmack's]] widely read journal, published via the [[finger protocol]]. Websites, including both corporate sites and [[personal homepage]]s, had and still often have "What's New" or "News" sections, often on the [[home page|index page]] and sorted by date. One example of a news based "weblog" is the [http://drudgereport.com/ "Drudge Report"] founded by the self styled maverick reporter [[Matt Drudge]], though apparently Drudge dislikes this classification. One noteworthy early precursor to a blog was the [[tongue-in-cheek]] personal website that was frequently updated by [[Usenet]] legend [[Kibo]].<br/>-<br/>-Early weblogs were simply manually updated components of common [[website]]s. However, the evolution of tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of web articles posted in said chronological fashion made the publishing process feasible to a much larger, less technical, population. Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of "blogging". blogs can be hosted by dedicated [[blog hosting service]]s, or they can be run using [[blog software]], such as [[blogger (service)|blogger]] or [[LiveJournal]], or on regular [[web hosting service]]s, such as [[DreamHost]].<br/>-<br/>-The term "weblog" was coined by [[Jorn Barger]] on [[17 December]] [[1997]]. The short form, "blog," was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word ''weblog'' into the phrase ''we blog'' in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May of 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6794172|title=It's the links, stupid|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=2006-4-20|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/19991013021124/http://peterme.com/index.html|title=Peterme.com|author=Peter Merholz|publisher=[[The Internet Archive]]|date=1999|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kottke.org/03/08/its-weblog-not-web-log|author=[[Jason Kottke]]|title=kottke.org|date=August 26, 2003|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref> This was quickly adopted as both a noun and verb ("to blog," meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog").<br/>-<br/>-After a slow start, blogging rapidly gained in popularity: the site [[Xanga]], launched in 1996, had only 100 diaries by 1997, but over 50,000,000 as of December 2005. Blog usage spread during 1999 and the years following, being further popularized by the near-simultaneous arrival of the first hosted blog tools:<br/>-* [[Open Diary]] launched in October 1998, soon growing to thousands of online diaries. Open Diary innovated the reader comment, becoming the first blog community where readers could add comments to other writers' blog entries.<br/>-* [[Brad Fitzpatrick]] started [[LiveJournal]] in March 1999.<br/>-* Andrew Smales created [[Pitas.com]] in July 1999 as an easier alternative to maintaining a "news page" on a website, followed by [[Diaryland]] in September 1999, focusing more on a personal diary community.<ref>Jensen, Mallory [http://www.cjr.org/issues/2003/5/blog-jensen.asp?printerfriendly=yes A Brief History of Weblogs]</ref><br/>-* [[Evan Williams (blogger)|Evan Williams]] and [[Meg Hourihan]] ([[Pyra Labs]]) launched [[blogger.com]] in August 1999 (purchased by [[Google]] in February 2003)<br/>-<!-- * Paul Kedrosky's [[GrokSoup]] -- EXPAND OR DELETE? --><br/>-<br/>-Blogging combined the personal web page with tools to make linking to other pages easier &mdash; specifically [[permalink]]s, [[blogroll]]s and [[TrackBack]]s. This, together with [[List of search engines#blog search engines|weblog search engines]] enabled bloggers to track the threads that connected them to others with similar interests.<br/>-<br/>-=== 2001 – 2004 ===<br/>-Several broadly popular American blogs emerged in 2001: [[Andrew Sullivan]]'s AndrewSullivan.com, [[Ron Gunzburger]]'s [[Politics1.com]], Taegan Goddard's [[Political Wire]] and [[Jerome Armstrong]]'s [[MyDD]] — all blogging primarily on [[political blog|politics]] (two earlier popular American political blogs were Bob Somerby's [[Daily Howler]] launched in 1998 and [[Mickey Kaus]]' Kausfiles launched in 1999).<br/>-<br/>-By 2001, blogging was enough of a phenomenon that how-to manuals began to appear, primarily focusing on technique. The importance of the blogging community (and its relationship to larger society) increased rapidly. Established schools of [[journalism]] began researching blogging and noting the differences between journalism and blogging.<br/>-<br/>-In 2002, Jerome Armstrong's friend and sometime [[business]] partner [[Markos Moulitsas Zúniga]] began [[Daily Kos|DailyKos]]. With up to a million visits a day during peak events, it has now become one of the Internet's most trafficked blogs.<br/>-<br/>-Also in 2002, many blogs focused on comments by [[United States Senate Majority Leader|U.S. Senate Majority Leader]] [[Trent Lott]]. Senator Lott, at a party honoring [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Strom Thurmond]], praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president. Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of [[racial segregation]], a policy advocated by Thurmond's [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential campaign]]. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See [[Josh Marshall]]'s ''[[Talking Points Memo]]''.) Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story.  Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.<br/>-<br/>-The impact of this story gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination. Though often seen as partisan gossips, bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead. More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media.<br/>-<br/>-Since 2002, blogs have gained increasing notice and coverage for their role in breaking, shaping, and [[Spin (public relations)|spinning]] [[news]] stories. The [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq war]] saw bloggers taking measured and passionate points of view that go beyond the traditional [[left-right politics|left-right]] divide of the [[political spectrum]].<br/>-<br/>-Blogging by established politicians and political candidates, to express opinions on war and other issues, cemented blogs' role as a news source. (See [[Howard Dean]] and [[Wesley Clark]].) Meanwhile, an increasing number of experts blogged, making blogs a source of in-depth analysis. (See Daniel Drezner and [[J. Bradford DeLong]].)<br/>-<br/>-The second Iraq war was the first "blog war" in another way: Iraqi bloggers gained wide readership, and one, [[Salam Pax]], published a book of his blog. Blogs were also created by soldiers serving in the Iraq war. Such "[[warblog]]" gave readers new perspectives on the realities of war, as well as often offering different viewpoints from those of official news sources.<br/>-<br/>-Blogging was used to draw attention to obscure news sources. For example, bloggers posted links to traffic cameras in Madrid as a huge anti-terrorism demonstration filled the streets in the wake of the [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|March 11 attacks]].<br/>-<br/>-Bloggers began to provide nearly-instant commentary on televised events, creating a secondary meaning of the word "blogging": to simultaneously transcribe and [[Editorial|editorialize]] speeches and events shown on television. (For example, "I am blogging Rice's testimony" means "I am posting my reactions to [[Condoleezza Rice|Condoleezza Rice's]] testimony into my blog as I watch her on television.") Real-time commentary is sometimes referred to as "liveblogging."<br/>-<br/>-=== 2004 – present ===<br/>-[[Image:Wordpress main theme.png|thumb|300px|A [[WordPress]] test blog running [[Kubrick (Wordpress theme)|Kubrick]].]]<br/>-In 2004, the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream, as [[political consultant]]s, news services and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming. Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the [[Labour Party (UK)|UK's Labour Party's]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Tom Watson (politician)|Tom Watson]], began to blog to bond with constituents.<br/>-<br/>-[[Minnesota Public Radio]] broadcast a program by [[Christopher Lydon]] and [[Matt Stoller]] called "The blogging of the President," which covered a transformation in politics that blogging seemed to presage. The ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' began regular coverage of blogs and blogging. Anthologies of blog pieces reached print, and blogging personalities began appearing on radio and television. In the summer of 2004, both United States [[Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[Republican National Convention|Republican]] Parties' conventions credentialed bloggers, and blogs became a standard part of the publicity arsenal. Mainstream television programs, such as [[Chris Matthews]]' ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]'', formed their own blogs. [[Merriam-Webster]]'s Dictionary declared "blog" as the word of the year in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/blog_declared_Word_of_the_Year Wikinews|publisher=Wikinews|title=blog declared Word of the Year|date=2004-12-01|accessdate=2006-06-22}}</ref><br/>-<br/>-Blogs were among the driving forces behind the "[[Rathergate]]" scandal, to wit: (television journalist) Dan Rather presented documents (on the CBS show ''[[60 Minutes]]'') that conflicted with accepted accounts of [[President Bush's military service]] record. Bloggers declared the documents to be [[forgery|forgeries]] and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view, and CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques (see [[Little Green Footballs]]). Many bloggers view this scandal as the advent of blogs' acceptance by the mass media, both as a source of news and opinion and as means of applying political pressure.<br/>-<br/>-Some bloggers have moved over to other media. The following bloggers (and others) have appeared on radio and television: [[Atrios|Duncan Black]] (known widely by his pseudonym, Atrios), [[Glenn Reynolds]] ([[Instapundit]]) , [[Markos Moulitsas Zúniga]] ([[Daily Kos]]), [[Alex Steffen]] ([[Worldchanging]]) and [[Ana Marie Cox]] ([[Wonkette]]). [[Hugh Hewitt]] is an example of a media personality who has moved in the other direction, adding to his reach in "old media" by being an influential blogger.<br/>-<br/>-Some blogs were an important source of news during the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|December 2004 Tsunami]] such as [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]], which used SMS text messaging to report from affected areas in Sri Lanka and Southern India.<br/>-<br/>-In the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' [[newspaper]] launched a redesign in September 2005, which included a daily digest of blogs on page 2. Also in June 2006, [[BBC News]] launched a weblog for its editors, following other news companies <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5116654.stm|title=Down with blogs... so here's another|first=Dawn|last=Wilson|date=2006-06-26|accessdate=2006-06-26|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>.<br/>-<br/>-In January 2005, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine listed eight bloggers that business people "could not ignore": [[Engadget|Peter Rojas]], [[Xeni Jardin]], [[Ben Trott]], [[Mena Trott]], [[Jonathan I.

Blogs, either used internally to enhance the communication and culture in a [[corporation]] or externally for [[marketing]], [[branding]] or [[Public relations|PR]] purposes are called [[corporate blog]]s.<br/>-<br/>-;[[List of search engines#blog search engines|Blog search engines]]: Several blog search engines are used to search blog contents (also known as the [[blogosphere]]), such as [[blogdigger]], [[Feedster]], and [[Technorati]]. Technorati provides current information on both popular searches and [[tag]]s used to categorize blog postings.<br/>-<br/>-== Business models ==<br/>-{{unsourced}}<br/>-While the great majority of blogs are non-commercial, full-time bloggers have struggled to find a way to make a profit from their work. The most common and simplest method is to accept targeted [[web banner|banner advertising]]. However, some bloggers have been hesitant to use this because of negative reader response to the ads. A more discreet form of advertising is for bloggers to promote merchandise from other sites, receiving a commission when a customer buys the item after following a blog link.<br/>-<br/>-Others have tried a [[click-to-donate]] model. Prominent political blogger [[Andrew Sullivan]] claimed at one point that accepting voluntary donations to his blog was more lucrative than his magazine work for [[The New Republic]]. Following the practice of public television, Sullivan boosted donations with periodic "[[pledge drives]]," one of which was reported to net him $120,000. Sullivan's attempt at securing corporate sponsorship for his blog fell apart after strong negative reader response to the deal.<br/>-<br/>-No other high-profile blogger has accepted a single corporate sponsor since Sullivan's failed deal. However, In the early twenty-first century, many magazines and newspapers began sponsoring personal blogs by their employees. The business model in this case is essentially the same as that of a traditional newspaper columnist. In a creative extension of the model, employees at other media companies began blogs focusing on the companies' products. For example, many actors in pornography blog about their work on company sites, creating a sense of personal connection between consumer and product.<br/>-<br/>-== Anatomy of a blog entry ==<br/>-[[Image:Typical blog.png|thumb|250px|A [[screenshot]] of a typical blog.]]<br/>-A variety of different systems are used to create and maintain blogs. Dedicated [[web application]]s can eliminate the need for bloggers to manage this software. With web interfaces, these systems allow travelers to blog from anywhere on the Internet, and allow users to create blogs without having to maintain their own server. Such systems allow users to work with tools such as Ecto, Elicit and [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] which allow users to maintain their Web-hosted blog without the need to be online while composing or editing posts. Blog creation tools and blog hosting are also provided by some Web hosting companies ([[Tripod]]), Internet service providers ([[America Online]]), online publications ([[Salon.com]]) and internet portals ([[Yahoo! 360°]] or [[Google]]). Some advanced users have developed custom blogging systems from scratch using [[Server-side scripting|server-side]] software, and often implement membership management and password protected areas. Others have created a mix of a blog and wiki, called a [[bliki]].<br/>-<br/>-A blog entry typically consists of the following:<br/>-* ''Title'', the main title, or headline, of the post.<br/>-* ''Body'', main content of the post.<br/>-* ''[[Permalink]]'', the [[URL]] of the full, individual article.<br/>-* ''Post Date'', date and time the post was published.<br/>-<br/>-A blog entry optionally includes the following:<br/>-* ''Comments''<br/>-* ''Categories'' (or [[tag]]s) - subjects that the entry discusses<br/>-* ''[[Trackback]]'' and or ''[[pingback]]'' - links to other sites that refer to the entry<br/>-<br/>-=== Comments ===<br/>-{{main|Feedback comment system}}<br/>-<br/>-Comments are a way to provide discussion on blog entries. Readers can leave a [[comment]] on a post, which can correct errors or contain their opinion on the post or the post's subject. Services like [[coComment]] aim to ease discussion through comments, by allowing tracking of them.<br/>-<br/>-== Blog popularity ==<br/>-Recently, researchers have analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular. There are essentially two measures of this: popularity through citations, as well as popularity through affiliation (i.e. [[blogroll]]). The basic conclusion from studies of the structure of blogs is that while it takes time for a blog to become popular through blogrolls, permalinks can boost popularity more quickly, and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls, since they denote that people are actually reading the blog's content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases.<ref>Marlow, C.

It gathered this information for over 4 years, and autonomously tracked the most contagious information spreading in the blog community. The project is no longer active.<br/>-<br/>-Blogs are also given rankings by [[Technorati]] based on the amount of incoming links and [[Alexa Internet]] based on the web hits of Alexa Toolbar users.  In August 2006, Technorati listed the most linked-to blog as that of Chinese actress [[Xu Jinglei]] and the most-read blog as group-written [[Boing Boing]].<ref>Fickling, David, [http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/archives/2006/08/15/internet_killed_the_tv_star.html Internet killed the TV star], [[The Guardian]] NewsBlog, [[15 August]] [[2006]]</ref><br/>-<br/>-It was reported by Chinese media [[Xinhua]] that the blog of [[Xu Jinglei]] received more than 50 million page views, claiming to be the most popular blog in the world.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-08/24/content_672747.htm]</ref>  In mid-2006, it also had the most incoming links of any blogs on the Internet.<ref>[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/archives/2006/08/15/internet_killed_the_tv_star.html]</ref><br/>-<br/>-==Blogging and the mass media==<br/>-Many bloggers differentiate themselves from the [[mainstream media]], while others are members of that media working through a different channel. Some institutions see blogging as a means of "getting around the filter" and pushing [[messages]] directly to the public. Some critics worry that bloggers respect neither [[copyright]] nor the role of the [[mass media]] in presenting society with credible news.<br/>-<br/>-Bloggers' credibility problem, however, can be an advantage for the bloggers and for the mainstream journalists who take an interest in them. News organizations are sometimes reluctant to tell stories that will upset important people. But when bloggers or activists make sensational claims, then they become stories themselves, and journalists can use them as cover for reporting the underlying scandals.<br/>-<br/>-Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs -- well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net's J-blog list. The first known use of a Weblog on a news site was in August 1998, when [[Jonathan Dube]] of The [[Charlotte Observer]] published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie.<ref>{{cite news|title=blogging Bonnie.|work=Poynter.org|date=18 September, 2003 |url=http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=52&aid=48413/}}</ref><br/>-<br/>-Blogs have also had an influence on [[minority language]]s, bringing together scattered speakers and learners; this is particularly so with blogs in [[Goidelic language|Gaelic languages]], whose creators can be found as far away from traditional Gaelic areas as [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Alaska]]. Minority language publishing (which may lack economic feasibility) can find its audience through inexpensive blogging.<br/>-<br/>-== Legal issues ==<br/>-The emergence of blogging has brought a range of legal liabilities.

Several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers and the courts have returned with mixed verdicts. In ''John Doe v. Patrick Cahill'', the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask anonymous bloggers, and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the [[trial court]] for reconsideration. In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to find the ISP address of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival. The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial. <ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/delawarestatecases/266-2005.pdf "John Doe No. 1 v.

For that mission he founded Arya Samaj enunciating the Ten Universal Principles as a code for Universalism ''Krinvanto Vishwaryam''  meaning the whole world be an abode for Nobles (Aryas). His next step was to take up the difficult task of reforming Hinduism with dedication despite multiple repeated attempts on his personal life.

By exhorting the nation to reject such superstitious notions, his aim was to educate the nation to ''Go back to the Vedas''. He wanted the people who followed Hinduism to go back to its roots and to follow the Vedic life, which he pointed out. He exhorted the Hindu nation to accept social reforms, including the importance of Cows for national prosperity as well as the adoption of [[Hindi]] as the national language for national integration. Through his daily life and practice of yoga and asanas, teachings, preaching, sermons and writings, he inspired the Hindu nation to aspire to ''Swarajya'' (self governance), nationalism, and spiritualism.
