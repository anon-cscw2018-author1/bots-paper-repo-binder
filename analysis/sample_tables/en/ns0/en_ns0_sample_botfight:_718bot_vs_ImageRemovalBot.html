The Atlantic House was a hangout for other literati of the period.  One, [[Tennessee Williams]], can be seen in photos that now hang in the bar in which he cavorts nude with male friends on the beach.<ref name="ah"/><br/> <br/> In 1950, Reginald "Reggie" Cabral and Mr. and Mrs. Frank J. Hurst bought the A-House. Cabral, who worked as manager, soon took over full ownership and made the long discreetly gay friendly establishment openly so.

The dancefloor may have been added by Cabral in the 1950s or maybe earlier. I've no clue when the upstairs Macho Bar was added nor when they started using the bit across the street that is now the restaurant.  All I know is that the 5 parts nentioned were in place since the late 1980s.--> the property has consisted of five parts.  There is the original tavern, now known as the Little Bar, an intimate space with a [[fireplace]] and [[jukebox]].  Upstairs from it is the Macho Bar, a space primarily for [[Leather subculture|leather men]] and decorated accordingly with [[International Mister Leather|IML]] posters, [[Tom of Finland]] images, etc.  In the larger wing, the ground level is a [[nightclub]] with dancefloor.  The area upstairs from this, once hotel rooms, has mostly been (and is currently) used only for storage.  A small building directly across Masonic Way (the short, [[Car-free zone|pedestrian way]] on Commercial Street where the A-House is located) was long-used as a storage space but is now a restaurant called Grand Central.  In the 1990s a sixth area was added, an enclosed exterior area in back and to the right of the large building which greatly expanded the nightclub's capacity.<ref name="ah"/><ref> [[Advertisement]]s from this place say "Provincetown's premier nightclub for over 25 years", hinting that the bottom floor of what was the hotel may have been converted into a dancefloor as late as the end of the 1970s.</ref><br/></td>

As far back as 1867 Parkes at an intercolonial conference had said: ''"I think the time has arrived when these colonies should be united by some federal bond of connexion."''  Shortly afterwards a bill to establish the proposed federal council was introduced by him and passed through both the New South Wales houses.  This was afterwards shelved by the action of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Various other conferences were held in the next 20 years at which the question came up, in which Parkes took a leading part, but in October 1884 he was blowing cold and suggesting that it would be "better to let the idea of federation mature in men's minds", and New South Wales then stood out of the proposed federal council scheme. <br/> <br/>-<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mp005988.jpg|left|thumb|A wood engraving of Sir Henry Parkes moving the first resolution at the federation conference in Melbourne, March 1 1890]] -->In October 1889 a report on the defences of Australia suggested among other things the federation of the forces of all the Australian colonies and a uniform gauge for railways.

The 16V came with the 1.4 16V 100&nbsp;PS (74&nbsp;kW) engine and had options such as 15" Spa alloys and air conditioning.  However more interest was in the GTI.  Available only in hatchback form, the GTI was powered by a 1.6 16V 125&nbsp;PS (92&nbsp;kW) engine with variable valve timing, making it the most powerful Polo to come out the factory to date. External changes gave the car the looks to match its power.  Deeper front bumpers with honeycomb mesh inserts, side skirts, fog lights, a honeycomb mesh grill and 15" BBS split rims suited the car well.  There were also standard extras such as "Climatronic" fully automatic air conditioning, Xenon headlights (with a headlight washer system), a 6 disc CD autochanger, exclusive sports interior with leather steering wheel and gearstick, chrome inserts and driver aids such as ABS with EBD and an EDL (a system to aid traction).  Leather and satellite navigation were also optional extras.  The Mk3F [[Volkswagen Polo GTI|Polo GTI]] however missed the new six-speed gearbox that was introduced in the smaller Lupo GTI.<br/></td>

Some of Lennon's post Beatles writings (songs), are believed to have in reality been written in total or in part, by other non-recognized contributors.

According to Goldman, on the day Lennon was murdered he was scheduled to undergo plastic surgery several days later to repair the part of his nose he supposedly had destroyed by snorting cocaine, which he supposedly did at the Hit Factory recording studio (where he recorded his Double Fantasy album). Goldman did not cite a single name of anyone who might have witnessed this at the studio.
