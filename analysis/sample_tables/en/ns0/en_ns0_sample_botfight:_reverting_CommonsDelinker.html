Samuelson experimented with different positions on the skis for several days until 2 July 1922. Samuelson discovered that leaning backwards in the water with ski tips up and poking out of the water at the tip was the optimal method. His brother Ben towed him and they reached a speed of {{convert|20|mph|km/h}}.<ref name=ABC-history/> Samuelson also achieved the first ski jump on 8 July 1925 using a greased {{convert|4|by|16|ft|m}} ramp. Samuelson spent 15 years performing shows and teaching water skiing to people in the United States. Experimenting further with the sport, Samuelson hooked up a line behind a [[World War 2]] flying boat with 200 horsepower and reached a speed of 80 miles per hour, making him the first speed skier.<br/> <br/> Samuelson went through several iterations of equipment in his quest to ski on water. His first equipment consisted of barrel staves for skis.<ref name=ABC-history>{{cite web|title=History of Water Skiing|url=http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/water-skiing/history.asp|work=ABC of Skiing|publisher=MaxLifestyle International Inc.}}</ref> He later tried [[Ski|snow skis]],<ref name=ABC-history/> but finally fabricated his own design out of lumber with bindings made of strips of leather.

The first patent for water skis was issued to Fred Waller, of Huntington, NY, on 27 October 1925, for skis he developed independently and marketed as "Dolphin Akwa-Skees." Waller's skis were constructed of kiln-dried mahogany, as were some boats at that time. Jack Andresen patented the first trick ski, a shorter, fin-less water ski, in 1940.</td>

The Sedan was not equipped witha a rear hatch so access to the cargo area required removal of the front seats, the ease of which was advertised as a positive feature. The [[chassis]] was steel, with a [[fibreglass]] body enclosing a large but sparse interior. Windows were perspex except for the front windscreen which was laminated glass. The doors were steel with sliding perspex windows.<br/> <br/> The tyres for the Sedan and Utility were Michelin 125 R12 as stated in the specifications. The four speed dog clutch [[Villiers Engineering]] gearbox had no reverse so the engine had to be switched off and started backwards which provide four reverse gears. Fuel was delivered by gravity feed from a tank behind the dashboard. The fuel gauge was a plastic pipe running from the top to the bottom of the tank with a graduated glass tube section on the dashboard. As a [[Wheels (magazine)]] road test in 1974 put it "it read anywhere from full to empty depending on gradient, throttle and probably Greenwich mean time".</td>

Also the songs "Roadrunner," "It Ain't What You Do," "I Will Stay" and "The Phone Rang" were classics. ''Roadrunner'' was recorded in Stockholm at Marcus Music Studios, and the album was also pressed in Stockholm. ''Roadrunner'' can be considered as one of the major Finnish rock albums, and it was Finland's best-selling album by a Finnish band in from 1974 until 1985, when the [[Dingo (band)|Dingos]]' ''Kerjäläisten valtakunta'' exceeded the volume of sales. Also the album cover art (by Risto Vuorimies) has become a classic: it was the only Finnish album cover in 1977's Hipgnosisin and Roger Dean's work Album Cover Album (Dragons, World Book). The ''Roadrunner'' cover was designed by Kari Korhonen, who also made a [[Donald Duck]] ("Rokkikukot") comic book version of the album cover. ''Roadrunner'' is still considered one of Finnish rock music's most important albums, and it is Finland's seventh-best-selling album of all time. The cover's stylish motif was chosen by Hurriganes' bassist Cisse Häkkinen, who owned a light blue 1954 Cadillac Series 62 sedan. The cover shows the Hurriganes' Remu Aaltonen, Cisse Häkkinen and Albert Järvinen posing elegantly in suits sitting on the back seat of the Cadillac. The car ended up in the ownership of Kari Niiranen, or "DJ Nite," a highly popular disc jockey who also toured with Hurriganes. ''Roadrunner'' is regarded as one of the best Finnish rock records ever released, and in 2007, it was re-released as a SACD mixed to a 5.1 format.<br/> <br/> ==Crazy Days: Kallio returns (1975)==</td>
