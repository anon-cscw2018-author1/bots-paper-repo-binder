Hoan was a crucial link between the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] and China, ambassador to [[Beijing]] 1950-1957, and leader of many delegations to China as Vice Chairman of the DRV National Assembly Standing Committee in the 1960s. He lost much of his influence after Ho Chi Minh's death in 1969, and particularly after the Fourth National Party Congress in 1977, when the Vietnamese Communists shifted to a pro-Soviet position. Like [[Truong Nhu Tang]], who went into exile in [[Paris]], Hoang defected and surfaced in Beijing in July 1979, after shaking off political persecution by the Vietnamese communist authorities.<br/> <br/> Hoang charged that Vietnam's abuse of its ethnic Chinese minority was "even worse than Hitler's treatment of the Jews" and that [[Hanoi]] had become "subservient to a foreign power," referring to the Soviet Union. Hoang disclosed that in 1982 North-Vietnam's Central Committee decided that [[opium]] production should be used to raise badly needed foreign currency, for example, U.S. dollars[http://www.heritage.org/Research/RussiaandEurasia/HL89.cfm].</td>

As a fielder in this instance typically cannot respond to the path of the ball quickly enough, players try to avoid encounters with in-between hops. While ground balls and throws in the dirt usually do not change direction, such factors as the spin of the baseball or imperfections of the playing surface can influence a bounce. An in-between hop contrasts with a ''short hop'', which refers to a baseball that reaches an infielder immediately after it bounces.<br/> <br/> The in-between hop is often responsible for errors in [[Infielder|infield]] play. In a December 2003 [[Baseball Digest]] interview, first baseman [[John Olerud]] cites the in-between hop as the toughest play for a fielder to handle.</td>

They are a purpose built race car, for [[drag racing]], they range in length from 180 inch [[wheelbase]] to 210 inch [[wheelbase]]. They were originally used in the highest class of drag racing, [[Top Fuel]], which uses [[nitromethane]] as a fuel and is usually blended with [[alcohol]] to dilute it which in turns slows down the cars. The front engine dragster naturally came about due to engines for the most part, being in front of the driver. However they used and still do not use any form of suspension, so the top fuel and alcohol cars became very unstable. This due in part to their making 2000 to 3000 [[horsepower]] (1.5 to 2.2 MW) and having poor tire technology, short wheelbases, and being very light. The driver sits angled backward, over the top of the rear [[differential (mechanics)|differential]] in a [[cockpit]] that is situated between the two rear tires. This position, led to many drivers being maimed when catastrophic clutch failures occurred. This led to the development of the rear engine dragster by [[Don Garlits]], which he designed while in the hospital, himself suffering from severe injuries caused by an exploding clutch.<br/></td>

Adaptive security can watch a network for malicious traffic and behavioral anomalies, ferret out end point vulnerabilities, identify real-time changes to systems, automatically enforce end point protections and access rules, block malicious traffic, follow a compliance dashboard while providing audit data, and more. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sans.org/webcasts/show.php?webcastid=91853 |title=Special Webcast: Real-Time Adaptive Security: Proactively Mitigating Risks |accessdate=06 January 2009}}</ref><br/> <br/> Among the key features of an adaptive security infrastructure are security platforms that share and correlate information rather than point solutions, so the heuristics system could communicate its suspicions to the firewall. Other features include finer-grained controls, automation (in addition to human intervention), on-demand security services, security as a service, and integration of security and management data. Rather than adding security to custom applications after they go operational, security models would be created at the design phase of an app.</td>
